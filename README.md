Description of the project:

This deliverable focuses on implementing a user account in a mobile application. Users can create their own user accounts with roles, which is the 'sign in' or 'log in' part of the project. Only thing is that whenever the user sign in or logs in the data isn't saved but that isn't a requirement for this deliverable. Furthereore, we implemented a 'Username' and 'Password' as requested in the project insructions.
