Description of the deliberable 1:

This deliverable focuses on implementing a user account in a mobile application. Users can create their own user accounts with roles, which is the 'sign in' or 'log in' part of the project. Only thing is that whenever the user sign in or logs in the data isn't saved but that isn't a requirement for this deliverable. Furthereore, we implemented a 'Username' and 'Password' as requested in the project insructions.

Description of deliverable 2:

This deliverable focuses on implementing different features for our app. We made sure that users with admin privileges could manage, add, edit, and delete event types while being able to edit each of these event details, such as age, pace, and level.
In addition, the admin account has the capability to remove both cycling club and participant accounts. We respected the project intructions and also added the UML.

Description of deliverable 3:

This deliverable focuses on implementing the club owner functionalities. The Club owner is able to complete club profile and create events that the admin had predefined in the last deliverable. 

Description of deliverable 4:

Our team successfully implemented the participant-related functionality in the Cycling Event Finder App. This deliverable focuses on the participants to search for cycling clubs, types of
events or specific events. The application should be displaying a list of cycling clubs organizing the desired events at the end if all works correctly.
