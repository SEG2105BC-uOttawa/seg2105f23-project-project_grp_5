Description of the deliberable 1:

This deliverable focuses on implementing a user account in a mobile application. Users can create their own user accounts with roles, which is the 'sign in' or 'log in' part of the project. Only thing is that whenever the user sign in or logs in the data isn't saved but that isn't a requirement for this deliverable. Furthereore, we implemented a 'Username' and 'Password' as requested in the project insructions.

Description of deliverable 2:

This deliverable focuses on implementing different features for our app. We made sure that users with admin privileges could manage, add, edit, and delete event types while being able to edit each of these event details, such as age, pace, and level.
In addition, the admin account has the capability to remove both cycling club and participant accounts. We respected the project intructions and also added the UML.
