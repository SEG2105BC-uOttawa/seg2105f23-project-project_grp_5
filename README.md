Description of the project:

The project involves the development of a GitHub repository where all project code will be managed collaboratively by team members. The primary focus of this project's deliverable is to implement a user account management component within a mobile application.

We have multiple and various key objectives that we have to consider such as setting up the GitHub Repository... We created a GitHub repository dedicated to the project, ensured that all project members are added as contributors to the repository, etc...

In addition, we made a user account management component where we had to develop a user account management system within the application. We also, provided users with the capability to create their own user accounts, which is the 'sign in' or 'log in' part of the project. Only thing is that whenever the user sign in or logs in the data isn't saved but that isn't a requirement for this deliverable. Furthereore, we implemented a 'Username' and 'Password' as requested in the project insructions.
We had to implement as well various user roles such a an 'admin' or as 'clubs' and 'participants'.

As a group we also created a Login and Welcome Screen where users can login without any problems. If that happens then the user would be directed to anoter screen with a personalized welcome message. From here on out we didn't have to make any additional parts or anything else function, since it wasn't a requirement for this project deliverable. Files such as code, uml, readme files etc... are all going to be provided in our github repository.

In conclusion, we were able to all collaborate together and work as a team by pushing, commiting and pulling code onto the github repository we created. We ended up with something that ressembles a github repository containing code for the user account management part of the application, where users would be able to create accounts, log in, and be greeted with personalized welcome messages based on their roles.
This deliverable focuses on implementing a user account in a mobile application. Users can create their own user accounts with roles, which is the 'sign in' or 'log in' part of the project. Only thing is that whenever the user sign in or logs in the data isn't saved but that isn't a requirement for this deliverable. Furthereore, we implemented a 'Username' and 'Password' as requested in the project insructions.
